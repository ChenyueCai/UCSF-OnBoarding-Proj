# Breast Density mini CV project 
This is a mini computer vision project that classifies a given DICOM breast image into two categories: high or low breast density. First, I preprocessed the given data so that there is a roughly even distribution of breast images of the two classes. I created the training set, the validation set, and the test set based on the selected images. Then, I created a basic ResNet architecture, trained the model and cross validated the hyperparameters. After that, I performed prediction with the algorithm on the testing set and achieved an 85% accuracy. Finally, I did error analysis by ploting the confusion matrix and ROC curve.
