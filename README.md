# Breast Density mini CV project 
This is a mini computer vision project that classify whether a given DICOM breast image suggests high or low breast density. First, I preprocessed the given data so that there is a roughly even distribution of breast images of the two classes. I created the train set, the validation set and the test set based on the selected 300+ images. Then, I created a basic ResNet architecture to train on breast denseness, train the model on training set and cross validate the hyperparameters. After that, I performed prediction with the algorithm on the testing set and achieved an 85% accuracy. Finally, I did error analysis by ploting the confusion matrix and ROC curve.
